# Cash Flow Minimizer



## Project Description
The Cash Flow Minimizer is a C-based application designed to efficiently settle debts among a group of people by minimizing the number of financial transactions. Given a set of transactions where individuals owe money to others, the program calculates the optimal way to settle debts while reducing the number of payments.



## Technologies Used
* C Programming Language: Chosen for its efficiency, low-level memory management, and execution speed.
* Data Structures: Implemented using queues and stacks to handle transaction processing and undo operations.
* Recursion: Used for minimizing transactions by iteratively balancing debts and credits.



## Challenges Faced
* Handling Large Data: Managing multiple transactions while keeping track of balances efficiently.
* Optimizing Transactions: Ensuring the minimum number of payments while covering all debts.
* Implementing Undo Feature: Designing a stack-based approach to allow users to undo the last transaction.



## Future Enhancements
* Graphical User Interface (GUI): Implementing a user-friendly GUI for better visualization of transactions.
* Database Integration: Storing transaction history for tracking financial records.
* Multi-Currency Support: Adding support for different currencies and exchange rates.
* User Authentication: Enabling multiple users to access and manage their transactions securely.
